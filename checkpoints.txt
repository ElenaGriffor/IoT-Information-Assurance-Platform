TODO Checkpoints:

1. Add Multiple Systems Feature:
   -> Create a dropdown menu for multiple systems (ventilator_OEM1, ventilator_OEM2)
   -> Each system will have its own JSON data file
   -> Implement ability to:
      - Load different ventilator configurations
      - Reset current configuration
      - Switch between different ventilator systems
      - Save state for each system independently
